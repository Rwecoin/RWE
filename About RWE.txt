According to Globe Newswire, a research report from ResearchAadMarkets.
com shows that the global market for block chain applications in agriculture and food is expected to reach US $ 1.4 billion by 2028. 
The world's top four agribusiness enterprises are digitizing international food trade using technologies such as block chains, including Cargill. 
The data show that the block chain technology has important application prospects in agriculture, 
and authentication and traceability are also one of the main application scenarios of the block chain. 
Using the characteristics of non-tampering and timestamps, 
the block chain technology has been applied in the circulation of agricultural products such as seedlings, 
and its application in agriculture is still relatively scarce. If the block chain technology is incorporated into the agricultural products trade agreement, 
the network security problem will be perfectly avoided and countries around the world will be able to realize seamless and secure transactions.
 Whether it is a large trade transaction between countries or a point-to-point transaction between individuals, it can be carried out safely and effectively.
 RWE is not only an agricultural product supply chain system ( bio - energy, organic planting and digital agriculture ), 
but also an intelligent agricultural digital platform based on block chain. 
Big data system will help scientific production and intelligent contract application to agriculture will help promote agricultural industrialization.
